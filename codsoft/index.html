        <h2>ABOUT THE IRON MAN</h2>  
        <p>> Vallabhbhai Jhaverbhai Patel (31 October 1875 â€“ 15 December 1950), commonly known as Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel
            was an Indian independence activist and barrister who served as the first Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister of India from 1947 to 1950</p>
        <p>>Patel was born in Nadiad, Kheda district and raised in the countryside of the state of Gujarat.[3] He was a successful lawyer. One of Mahatma Gandhi's earliest political lieutenants, he organised peasants from Kheda, Borsad and Bardoli in Gujarat in non-violent civil disobedience against the British Raj,
             becoming one of the most influential leaders in Gujarat</p>
        <p>>He was appointed as the 49th President of Indian National Congress.
            Under the chairmanship of Patel "Fundamental Rights and Economic Policy" resolution was passed by the Congress. Patel's position at the highest level in the Congress was largely connected with his role from 1934 onwards (when the Congress abandoned its boycott of elections) in the party organisation</p>

        <h2>EARLY LIFE AND BACKGROUND</h2>
        <p>>Sardar Vallabhbhai Jhaverbhai Patel,one of the six children of Jhaverbhai Patel and Ladba, was born in Nadiad, Gujarat. He followed Vaishnavism and belonged to Pushtimarg sect of Mahaprabhu Vallabhacharya and took the diksha from the descendant of Vallabhacharya.</p>
        <p>>Patel travelled to attend schools in Nadiad, Petlad, and Borsad, living self-sufficiently with other boys. He reputedly cultivated a stoic character. A popular anecdote recounts that he lanced his own painful boil without hesitation, even as the barber charged with doing it trembled</p>
        <p>>When Patel passed his matriculation at the relatively late age of 22, he was generally regarded by his elders as an unambitious man destined for a commonplace job. Patel himself, though,
             harboured a plan to study to become a lawyer, work and save funds, travel to England, and become a barrister.</p>
